# MotiveLens
**MotiveLens** is a frontend-based forensic psychology web application designed to simulate how behavioral analysis can assist in criminal investigations. The platform allows users to input structured crime case details and generates psychological profiling insights, risk assessment indicators, and organized investigative recommendations. MotiveLens aims to bridge the gap between theoretical forensic psychology concepts and practical investigative reasoning through an interactive and user-friendly digital interface.

The core idea behind MotiveLens is to demonstrate how crime scene characteristics, suspected motives, and behavioral indicators can be translated into structured analytical outputs. By processing user-provided inputs, the system produces profiling interpretations that reflect organized versus disorganized behavioral traits, potential motivational drivers, and contextual risk levels. This approach mirrors foundational principles used in investigative psychology and behavioral profiling, while remaining accessible and easy to interact with.

The application includes features such as crime motivation analysis, risk meter visualization, structured profiling output, and investigation recommendation panels. Each feature is designed to provide logical, scenario-based insights that help users understand how psychological reasoning may guide investigative direction. Although it does not replace real-world forensic analysis, MotiveLens serves as a conceptual prototype demonstrating how digital tools can assist structured decision-making processes.

Built entirely using frontend technologies, the project emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and clean user experience design. The system operates without a backend, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy. Its modular structure also allows for future scalability, including the potential integration of advanced analytics, data storage, or AI-driven modeling.

Overall, MotiveLens represents an exploratory step toward combining technology and forensic psychology principles into an interactive analytical tool. It showcases how structured behavioral reasoning can be transformed into a functional web-based investigative assistant.
